# Inlein

Run Clojure scripts with dependencies, but without classpath pains.

## Installation

Inlein installs itself on the first run of the `inlein` script; there is no
separate install script. Follow these instructions to install Inlein
manually:

1. Make sure you have a Java JDK **version 7** or later.
2. [Download the `inlein` script from the `stable` branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyPiRion/inlein/stable/bin/inlein)
 of this project.
3. Place it on your `$PATH`. (`~/bin` is a good choice if it is on your path.)
4. Set it to be executable. (`chmod 755 ~/bin/inlein`)
5. Run it.
