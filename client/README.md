# inlein client

This is the inlein client. The client is a program that calls the inlein daemon
(and starts/downloads it if it is not found), and interprets/runs the results
received from the daemon.

If you want to run a snapshot version of Inlein, you must also install the
Inlein daemon manually. See the `daemon` directory for more information on how
to do that. Keep in mind that this version won't be upgradable, so you have to
reinstall inlein if you want move back to a stable version.

## Developing

The easiest way to develop the inlein client is by running `lein run -- your
params here`. If you mainly work on the daemon, you may prefer faster client
startup speeds. Running `lein uberjar` will create `target/inlein`, which is a
fast executable snapshot version of the client.
